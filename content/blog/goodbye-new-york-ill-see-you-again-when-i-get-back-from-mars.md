I took this photo in 2012 after living in NYC for a year. I took it from the Governor's Island Ferry while I was taking a group of hackNY 2012 fellows to some cohort building activities. It is one of my favorite memories of this city.

I'm leaving New York City. I moved here for the first time in 2011 as part of a [hackNY fellowship](http://hackny.org). I moved here right after finishing up an internship at NASA and it was my first time working for a startup. Since then I've had the absolute pleasure to work with some really amazing people at Fondu (SpotOn), MongoDB, Amazon Web Services -- and literally thousands of individuals. Work is a big part of my life and this city would not have been as amazing without all the wonderful startups that make the tech ecosystem in NYC so powerful.

I stumbled into the developer evangelism role after spending a lot of time focused on some internal infrastructure at MongoDB. I realized that I enjoyed public speaking, hackathons, and working face to face with other engineers on a wide variety of projects. Developers have a very privileged place in society and it was very exciting to see so many people recognizing that and trying to use their skills to accomplish many socially responsible goals. After spending the past year at AWS I've decided to pursue a life long dream of working in the space industry.

On July 27th I'll start working on infrastructure and automation at SpaceX with the ultimate goal of making humanity a multi-planetary species. I'm very excited about this but very sad to leave the amazing city of New York behind.

I've made a small photo album to describe my feelings about New York and to encourage other people to go there and explore: [here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152885606436246.1073741839.519786245&type=1&l=f877f5f655).
